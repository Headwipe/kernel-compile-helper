# kernel-compile-helper

This simple script will help you to install the required software to compile a Kernel on Linux.

You just need to Download it an execute with ```./kernel-helper.sh ```


When you are asked which version of Kernel you want to Download, choose one from https://kernel.org
Example: ```4.7.3```
It will download it by itself.

For now it will use ``defconfig`` and ``menuconfig`` for configuration of the Kernel.


Tested on OS:
- Debian 8/Jessie
